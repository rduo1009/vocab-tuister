## Additional Rules
Write unit tests for all new functions. Unit tests should be extensive, especially if the function is complicated.
Use pytest for Python tests, and testify for Go tests.
Python and Go test files should be named in the format "thing being tested"_test.py or "thing being tested"_test.go respectively

Focus on code readability and maintainability. Variable names should not be too long, but should be clear anyway.
A comment explaining a variable is better than a long variable name.

For Python code, always provide docstrings in the Numpy style.
For Go code, always provide doccomments in the style used in idiomatic Go. Follow the style of the standard library doccomments.
Write comments liberally inside the code as well. A viewer should be able to understand what the code does without understanding
or reading the code itself.
